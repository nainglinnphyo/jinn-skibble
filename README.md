# Nest.js Starter Kit

This starter kit provides a foundation for building scalable and maintainable server-side applications using Nest.js. It is designed to seamlessly integrate with Prisma Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) libraries for efficient data handling.

## Features

- **Nest.js Framework**: Utilizes the robust Nest.js framework for building scalable applications with TypeScript.
- **Prisma ORM Integration**: Seamless integration with Prisma ORM for efficient database operations.
- **Custom Exception Handling**: Implemented custom exceptions to handle errors gracefully.
- **Router Module**: the route path for a handler is determined by concatenating the (optional) prefix declared for the controller.
- **Exception Filters**: Added exception filters to centralize error handling and enhance application robustness.
- **Custom Decorators**: Included custom decorator functions to extend functionality and simplify common tasks.
